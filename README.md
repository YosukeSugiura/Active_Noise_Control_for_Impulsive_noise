# Active Noise Control for Impulsive Noise

[**Python Version is available now!**](https://github.com/YosukeSugiura/Active_Noise_Control_for_Impulsive_noise)

This repository provides MATLAB implementations of various **Feedforward Active Noise Control (ANC)** algorithms designed to suppress **impulsive noise**. These algorithms are evaluated and compared in terms of their Adaptive Noise Reduction (ANR) performance.

## Usage

1. Downlaad all files

2. Open MATLAB and run the following script:

```matlab
main.m
```

3. The script will:

- Load predefined ANC scenarios with impulsive noise
- Run all methods sequentially
- Plot the Adaptive Noise Reduction (ANR) curves
- Save the result as `comparison.png`

## Results

The figure below shows the comparative performance of each algorithm under impulsive noise (α-stable noise with α=1.65).
